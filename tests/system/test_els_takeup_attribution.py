"""The 2026-08-08 hardware defect, driven end to end over the real Modbus link.

WHAT HAPPENED ON THE MACHINE
----------------------------
Half-nut open, operator presses Cut. The firmware's backlash take-up
confirmation gate correctly WITHHELD the pass -- and then the operator nudged
the carriage by hand and the gate released it. A hand-pushed carriage was
accepted as proof the half-nut was engaged, which is precisely the failure the
whole take-up-confirmation feature exists to prevent.

The gate asked "did Z move?" when the question it had to answer is "did Z move
BECAUSE WE DROVE IT?". reflex-fw commit b3b78e3 bounded how long it would keep
listening (~250 ms, ELS_TAKEUP_CONFIRM_WINDOW_TICKS) which shrank the exposure
without changing its shape: any Z motion from any source inside that window
still counted. Motion attribution (reflex-fw Core/Inc/els_slip.h) is what
changed the shape -- only Z counts arriving while the servo was driving, or
within a settle horizon of a real pulse, are evidence.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE FIRMWARE'S OWN
-------------------------------------------------
reflex-fw's els_takeup_confirm_test.cpp already pins this at the ISR level, and
els_slip_test.cpp pins the horizon's timing properties. Neither goes through
Modbus, the HAL, or the FSM stack -- so neither can catch the take-up being
configured wrong on the way down (backlashSteps never written, thread geometry
mismatched, the gate reading a threshold the host never pushed). This test
drives the REAL reflex-ui controller against the REAL firmware and asks the
same question the operator did.

It is also the first system test to read the take-up registers at all.

WHAT MAKES IT A TEST RATHER THAN A TAUTOLOGY
--------------------------------------------
A machine that refuses EVERYTHING passes any "it refused" assertion. Three
things guard against that reading:

  * ``test_coupled_takeup_still_confirms`` runs the identical setup with the
    half-nut CLOSED and requires the take-up to CONFIRM. If attribution ever
    over-refuses, that test goes red, not this one.
  * Inside the refusal test, ``lastTakeupZDelta`` is asserted ~0 BEFORE the
    nudge and large AFTER it. The firmware demonstrably SAW the carriage move;
    it declined to treat it as evidence. Without this, a run where the nudge
    silently failed to reach the physics would pass for entirely the wrong
    reason.
  * ``takeupPending`` is asserted STILL 1 at the moment the motion is observed.
    That is the host-visible proxy for "the confirmation window had not closed
    yet" (the firmware's own elsStopTakeupLatched is ISR-private). Without it
    the test would pass on the pre-existing window timeout -- the behaviour
    b3b78e3 already shipped -- and would prove nothing about attribution.

TIMING BUDGET (emulator ticks are NOT hardware ticks)
-----------------------------------------------------
The emulator ISR runs at isr_rate_hz = 10 kHz (reflex-fw
emulator/config/lathe.toml), 10x slower than the ~100 kHz the firmware's tick
constants assume. So in emulator WALL-CLOCK:

    ELS_SLIP_SETTLE_TICKS       1000 ticks  ->  ~100 ms   (nudge must land AFTER)
    ELS_TAKEUP_CONFIRM_WINDOW  25000 ticks  ->  ~2.5 s    (nudge must land BEFORE)

_NUDGE_DWELL_S sits between them with margin on both sides. A run that misses
the window fails on the ``takeupPending``/``lastTakeupZDelta`` assertions with
an explicit message rather than passing quietly.

CROSS-REPO PAIRING -- READ THIS BEFORE BELIEVING A CI FAILURE
------------------------------------------------------------
This test requires firmware that has the closed-loop take-up confirmation gate
AND motion attribution (reflex-fw Core/Inc/els_slip.h, branch
feat/els-slip-attribution off integration).

.github/workflows/ci.yml pins the reflex-fw checkout to `dev-staging`, which as
of 2026-08-10 has NEITHER -- it predates the whole feature (b98b398 closed-loop
cal + take-up confirmation, b62722c derived threshold, b3b78e3 bounded window
are all absent) and sits 7+ commits behind integration.

So in CI BOTH tests here fail, including the coupled positive control, and both
fail EARLY with:

    the take-up gate never published an outcome: takeupSeq still 0,
    takeupPending=0, takeupResult=0, backlashSteps=300

That is the pairing signature: backlashSteps reached the firmware, and the
firmware simply has no gate to answer with. It is a statement about the FIRMWARE
BEING OLD, not a regression in this repo -- and note it is NOT the
"A HAND-PUSHED CARRIAGE RELEASED THE TAKE-UP GATE" message, which would mean
something genuinely alarming. Check the reflex-fw SHA in the pytest header
before drawing any conclusion. Bumping the pairing is a deliberate act, per the
rule in AGENTS.md.

(ci.yml's `system-tests` job is continue-on-error, and the semantic-release
workflow is a separate file gated on main/dev, so a red here releases nothing
and blocks nothing.)

EMULATOR GREEN IS NOT A HARDWARE RESULT: no servo dynamics beyond the model, no
metal, and ELS_SLIP_SETTLE_TICKS is UNCOMMISSIONED (reflex-fw todo.md) -- it
cannot even be measured here, because the emulator's lash model moves the
carriage instantaneously with the pulse. The elspi verification pass is Evan's.
