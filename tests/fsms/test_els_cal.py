"""Tests for BacklashCalibration (the closed-loop backlash calibration run).

Exercised against a fake HAL that models the firmware's ACTUAL ack semantics:
``calCommand`` is cleared immediately on consume and ``calSeq`` only increments
when the run finishes. A test that let the controller poll ``calCommand`` for
completion would pass against a naive fake and fail against real firmware, so
the fake is deliberately built to punish that.

The properties under test are the ones that make the feature safe rather than
merely present:

  - a firmware refusal must surface as an operator-legible cause, never a
    silent proceed;
  - an INCONSISTENT run must be rejected — the spread is the finding, and
    widening the tolerance to proceed is the exact anti-pattern this guards;
  - only the COMMANDED take-up (measured + margin) reaches the firmware
    register, while the raw measurement is stored separately, because
    ElsStopFsm._safety_margin_display depends on that distinction.

Mutation notes on individual cases record the edit that must break them.
