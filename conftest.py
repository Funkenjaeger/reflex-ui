"""Repo-root pytest configuration.

Force Kivy's mock GL/window backends for the entire test suite. Any test that
imports the app or a dispatcher pulls in Kivy; on WSLg (and headless CI) a real
SDL2/OpenGL context takes ~135 s to initialize and needs a display, which is
what made test collection crawl. No pytest test renders anything (the README
screenshot capture is a standalone script, not a test), so mock graphics is
safe and makes imports near-instant.

This MUST run before any `import kivy` selects a backend. A repo-root conftest
is imported by pytest before collecting any test module, so this is the earliest
reliable hook.

    ``KIVY_WINDOW=mock`` above is not a real window provider (Kivy has none), so
    ``EventLoop.window`` stays ``None`` and any test that constructs a real Kivy
    ``Widget`` hits ``EventLoop.ensure_window()`` -> ``sys.exit(1)`` ("Unable to
    get a Window, abort."). Dispatcher/FSM/system tests never build widgets so
    they were unaffected; the screen tests are. A real sdl2 window is not an
    option here -- it needs OpenGL (the ``dummy`` SDL video driver has none) and,
    with a display, costs ~2 min just for window init.

    So install a lightweight stub window that satisfies ``ensure_window()`` and
    lets widgets build headlessly. Idempotent and a no-op when a real window
    already exists (e.g. running the suite on a machine with a display)."""
