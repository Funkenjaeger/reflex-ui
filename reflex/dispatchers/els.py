    #       the Z scale moving IS the open-half-nut / uncoupled failure, so it
    #       must sit comfortably past the largest credible lash but well short
    #       of anything the carriage could hit. It costs nothing to be generous:
    #       a leg ends the moment Z moves, so this only bounds the FAILURE case.
    #
    #       MEASURED ON elspi 2026-08-08: 385 steps (~0.76 mm) of real lash.
    #       That is roughly 4x the 0.05-0.20 mm range this feature was designed
    #       against, and it makes a tight ceiling actively dangerous: the first
    #       default here was 400 steps, which left EIGHTEEN steps of headroom
    #       over the measurement. A healthy machine was ~0.036 mm of lash drift
    #       away from reporting a false "carriage did not move - is the half-nut
    #       engaged?". Sized at ~2 mm now, about 2.6x the measured lash.

    # at a mechanical stop it was already against, so missing by more than a
    # couple of counts means the Z chain has lost custody of the position —
    # the same fault that would silently corrupt every ELS operation. That is
