"""Interactive re-sync to an existing thread — run controller.

Walks one manual reference latch: the operator establishes a physically
verified point on an existing thread's helix, and the firmware captures the
same (latchedSpindle, latchedZ) pair the first-trigger auto-latch would have.
Everything downstream of the latch (take-up, phase correction, resume) is
unchanged and unaware of which producer latched the reference.

THE PROCEDURE THIS ENFORCES (order is load-bearing)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Coarse jog, CUTTING DIRECTION ONLY, into the threaded region. The
   cutting-direction constraint loads the leadscrew lash on the correct side —
   the same side a real pass starts from. Fine-tuning by jogging is forbidden:
   it would need bidirectional motion across the lash and is not repeatable.
2. Fine alignment is NOT a Z operation. The operator rotates the SPINDLE by
   hand and works the CROSS-SLIDE to ease the tool into the groove. Z is HELD.
3. This controller watches the Z scale throughout step 2. After the
   cutting-direction jog the nut sits hard against its drive flank, so retract
   is mechanically blocked and the only motion the carriage is capable of is
   drifting FURTHER in the cutting direction through the free play — which is
   why the monitor is not direction-aware: any Z motion IS that drift.
4. On confirm, the firmware latches (spindle, Z) in one ISR pass.

THE TOLERANCE IS A FINDING, NOT A KNOB
--------------------------------------
Drift is recoverable: the operator nudges the carriage back BY HAND until it
re-seats against the drive flank — arriving back at a mechanical stop it was
already sitting against, so the Z readout must return to the post-jog baseline
within a couple of encoder counts. A re-seat that misses by more means the Z
chain (scale, counting, mechanics) has lost custody, and the SAME fault would
silently corrupt every other ELS operation. That is a RED FLAG to surface and
stop on. Do NOT widen the tolerance to make the wizard proceed. The corollary:
a clean re-seat within tolerance positively confirms the whole Z chain — the
wizard is incidentally a drivetrain integrity check.

WHY THE ACK IS A SEQUENCE COUNTER, NOT A FLAG
---------------------------------------------
``latchCommand`` is cleared by the FIRMWARE the instant the ISR consumes it.
Edge-detect ``latchSeq`` against a baseline captured at request time, exactly
like ``calSeq`` (see els_cal.py). A latch requested with ``enable == 0`` is
consumed with NO seq increment — the absent ack IS the refusal.
