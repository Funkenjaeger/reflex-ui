"""Backlash calibration run controller.

Drives one closed-loop calibration: push the machine limits, request the run,
wait for the firmware's ack, judge the result, and (only if it passes) commit
the take-up command.

WHY THE ACK IS A SEQUENCE COUNTER, NOT A FLAG
---------------------------------------------
``calCommand`` is cleared by the FIRMWARE the instant the ISR consumes it —
long before the run finishes. Polling it for completion reports "done"
immediately and reads a stale result. ``calSeq`` increments once per finished
run, success or refusal, so edge-detecting it against a baseline captured at
request time is the only way a host polling at Modbus rates cannot alias a fast
run. Everything here is built around that.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
It does not widen the acceptance spread to make a run succeed. A wide spread
means the measurement is not reproducible, and that IS the finding — the same
class of fault that would silently corrupt every other ELS operation. Surface
it; do not work around it.

It also never writes the raw measurement to ``els_backlash_steps``. That
property holds the COMMANDED take-up (measured + margin); the raw measurement
lives in ``els_cal_last_measured_steps``. ``ElsStopFsm._safety_margin_display``
depends on that distinction.
