"""Recorder for the firmware diagnostic scratchpad.

Watches ``elsStop.diagSeq`` for a completed capture and appends the whole block
to a JSONL file, so the data lands somewhere analysable instead of somewhere you
have to transcribe off a 1024x600 touchscreen at the lathe.

THREE PROPERTIES THIS MUST HAVE, and each one is load-bearing:

1. **Inert against release firmware.** The scratchpad is reserved in every build
   but written only when reflex-fw is compiled with ``ELS_DIAG_SCRATCH``. This
   reads ``diagSchema`` once per connection; if it is 0 (or a number this UI does
   not know) the recorder disables itself for that connection and issues no
   further reads at all. Against production firmware the steady-state cost is
   exactly zero, not merely small.

2. **Cheap to watch, expensive only on demand.** ``diagSeq`` is one register, so
   polling it is free. The 64-register block read -- roughly 12 ms of serial time
   at 115200 baud -- happens only when the firmware has said, via its own ack,
   that a capture is complete. That split is the entire reason ``diagSeq``
   exists, and there is deliberately no capture-in-progress register: polling one
   would race the ISR and could read a half-written trace.

3. **Incapable of taking the UI down.** A diagnostic that can break the machine
   control surface is worse than no diagnostic. Every operation is guarded, and
   repeated failures disable the recorder rather than retrying forever against a
   fault that is not going to clear.

NO UNIT CONVERSION HAPPENS HERE. Bucket width is recorded in ISR ticks, and the
ISR's measured interval in CPU cycles is recorded alongside it, so ticks can be
converted to seconds from the capture itself. reflex-fw's own documentation
disagrees with itself about the ISR rate by 10x (AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
say ~100 us, todo.md and els_slip.h say 100 kHz, and reflex.ioc describes a third
rate it has not matched since 2024), so a conversion baked in here would be a
confident wrong answer. Record what was measured; convert when analysing.

        it is zeroed by a power cycle, which this board requires after every
